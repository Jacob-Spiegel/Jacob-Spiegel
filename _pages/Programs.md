## Computer Aided Drug Design (CAAD) Programs

- **AutoGrow4**: AutoGrow4 is an open-source program for semi-automated computer-aided drug discovery. It uses a genetic algorithm to evolve predicted ligands on demand and so is not limited to a virtual library of pre-enumerated compounds. AutoGrow4 is a useful tool for generating entirely novel drug-like molecules and for optimizing preexisting ligands.<br />

## Cheminformatic Programs

- **Gypsum-DL**: Gypsum-DL is a free, open-source program that converts 1D and 2D small-molecule representations (SMILES strings or flat SDF files) into 3D models. It outputs models with alternate ionization, tautomeric, chiral, cis/trans isomeric, and ring-conformational states.<br />
